# Stock Analysis
## Instructions and Objectives 
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

Analyze code and explain how it accomplishes a task.

Evaluate logic flow of for loops and conditionals.

Extend your pattern recognition skills to refactor existing code.

## Refactoring 
Create arrays for all the volumes, starting prices, and ending prices.

I am taking advantage of the fact that the tickers are all in alphabetical order.

I used tickerIndex to access the correct index across the four different arrays I will be using (the tickers array and the three output arrays). tickers(tickerIndex) will give the current ticker I am working on.

Once I cimpleted collecting the data, loop through your arrays to output all of the information I collected. The formatting code will work without needing to be changed.
